# Memory-Management-API-Phase-1

Implement a memory heap management API, and we will
provide a code for you to test your API. You are expected to create a shared memory, in
order to manage memory requests coming from multiple threads and grant or decline
requests based on free space available. You are also expected to manage all mutexes
and semaphores for shared memory access.
